/**
 * Odd bits are getting ready for Bits Battles.
 *
 * Therefore the n bits march from right to left along an 8 bits path. Once the most-significant bit reaches the left their march is done. Each step will be saved as an array of 8 integers.
 *
 * Return an array of all the steps.
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 8
 *
 * NOTE: n != 0, because n represents the number of 1s.
 *
 * Examples
 * This resembles a simple 8 LED chaser:
 *
 * n = 3
 *
 * 00000111
 * 00001110
 * 00011100
 * 00111000
 * 01110000
 * 11100000
 * n = 7
 *
 * 01111111
 * 11111110
